## Common Error Codes and Troubleshooting

### Error Code E1234: API Connection Failure

**Symptoms:**
- "Unable to connect to cloud provider API" message
- Dashboard shows resources as "Unavailable"
- Failed to retrieve resource metrics

**Causes:**
1. Invalid or expired API credentials
2. Network connectivity issues
3. Cloud provider service outage
4. Firewall blocking outbound connections

**Resolution Steps:**

1. Verify API credentials:
   - Navigate to Settings > Connections
   - Check if the API key status shows as "Valid"
   - If expired, generate new credentials in your cloud provider console
   - Update credentials in TechSolutions platform

2. Check network connectivity:
   - Ensure your TechSolutions instance can reach the cloud provider API endpoints
   - Verify any proxy settings are correctly configured
   - Run the built-in connectivity test in Diagnostics > Network Test

3. Check cloud provider status:
   - Visit your cloud provider's status page to check for ongoing outages
   - If services are down, wait for restoration and set up notifications

4. Firewall configuration:
   - Ensure your firewall allows outbound connections to the following endpoints:
     - api.aws.amazon.com (for AWS)
     - management.azure.com (for Azure)
     - cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com (for GCP)
   - Default port: 443/HTTPS

2. Missing permissions for automated actions
3. Resource constraints
4. External service dependencies unavailable

**Resolution Steps:**

1. Workflow validation:
   - Check workflow definition for logical errors
   - Verify all required parameters are provided
   - Review execution logs in Automation > Workflow History

2. Permission check:
   - Ensure workflow service account has necessary permissions
   - Check if any recent permission changes affect the workflow
   - Verify service account token is valid

3. Resource availability:
   - Check if workflow engine has sufficient resources
   - Verify target systems have capacity for requested actions
   - Consider scaling workflow execution nodes if consistently failing

4. External dependencies:
   - Verify all integrated services are operational
   - Check connectivity to external APIs
   - Review timeout settings for external calls

## Best Practices

### Kubernetes Resource Management

1. **Resource Limits and Requests**
   - Always define both CPU and memory limits and requests
   - Set realistic limits based on application profiling
   - Consider using vertical pod autoscaler for initial sizing

2. **Namespace Organization**
   - Use namespaces to logically separate workloads
   - Implement resource quotas at the namespace level
   - Follow consistent naming conventions

3. **Pod Disruption Budgets**
   - Implement PDBs for critical services
   - Ensure high-availability services maintain minimum replicas
   - Test cluster maintenance scenarios

4. **Efficient Resource Utilization**
   - Regularly review resource utilization with TechSolutions' Cost Optimizer
   - Clean up unused resources (PVCs, services, etc.)
   - Consider spot/preemptible instances for non-critical workloads

### Security Hardening

1. **Network Policy Implementation**
   - Follow zero-trust principle with explicit network policies
   - Limit egress traffic to required destinations
   - Implement namespace isolation

2. **Secret Management**
   - Use TechSolutions' Secrets Vault for sensitive information
   - Rotate secrets regularly
   - Implement least-privilege access to secrets

3. **Container Hardening**
   - Run containers as non-root users
   - Use read-only file systems where possible
   - Remove unnecessary packages and tools from images

4. **Regular Security Scanning**
   - Schedule automated image scanning
   - Perform routine compliance checks
   - Address high and critical vulnerabilities promptly

### Performance Optimization

1. **Monitoring Strategy**
   - Implement RED method (Rate, Errors, Duration)
   - Use custom metrics for business-specific indicators
   - Set up proactive alerts before issues impact users

2. **Database Optimization**
   - Review and optimize query performance
   - Implement appropriate caching strategies
   - Scale read replicas for read-heavy workloads

3. **Application Profiling**
   - Use TechSolutions' Application Profiler to identify bottlenecks
   - Optimize container startup times
   - Implement efficient health check mechanisms

4. **Scaling Strategies**
   - Define appropriate horizontal pod autoscaling
   - Consider node auto-provisioning for variable workloads
   - Implement graceful degradation for traffic spikes
